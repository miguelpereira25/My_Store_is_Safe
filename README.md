# My Store is Safe!


My project consists of an application where the user can check up on symptoms of himself and others, the idea is to use in small businesses so that they can have the proper records and create a summary at the end of the day.
The application has a digital agenda that allows customers to book and make a checklist of government requirements that allow cancellations and specify the reasons for cancellations.
In the future, it will also be possible to access an employee status record, for example, how many are quarantined, how many are home watching their minor children.
